"Bharti Singh details her ‘automatic’ intermittent fasting routine, breakfast, dinner timings: ‘White butter, paratha, and black tea...’","Comedian Bharti Singh shared her successful experience with intermittent fasting (IF), maintaining a 16-hour fasting window from 7 PM to 10 AM daily, followed by a ""proper breakfast thali"" and then dinner at 7 PM. Dt. Vaishali Verma, a consultant in nutrition and dietetics, explains that IF, particularly the popular 16/8 method, involves cycling between eating and fasting periods, shifting the body from sugar to stored fat for energy. When done correctly, IF can lead to weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and reduced inflammation. While generally suitable for most healthy adults, Verma emphasizes consulting a doctor before starting, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those with a history of eating disorders. During the fasting window, non-caloric drinks like water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea are permitted, and it's crucial to listen to one's body and break the fast if feeling unwell.",2025-12-16 00:30:59,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/bharti-singh-automatic-intermittent-fasting-routine-breakfast-dinner-timings-eat-7-pm-expert-10161097/,indianexpress
